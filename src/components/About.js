          Hello, I'm UÄŸur, a passionate Frontend Developer. I graduated from
          Bilkent University with a degree in Computer Technology and
          Information Systems (CTIS). I am fluent in English and currently
          specialize in developing software using React and React Native. I
          thrive on creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces to
          enhance the user experience.
